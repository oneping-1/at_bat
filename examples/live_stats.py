This module will print the details for the most recent pitch in a MLB
and MiLB games provided with a gamePk from the MLB/MiLB website

You can find the gamePk for a given game by going to the 'Gameday'
section of the desired game and by looking for a string of 6 consecutive
numbers in the url.

Functions:
    print_last_pitch(gamePk, delay_seconds): Prints live stats for the
        given game based off the gamePk argument with a delay in
        seconds if delay_seconds argument is provided
    main(): Gets gamePk and delay_seconds from command line arguments
        and prompts user for input if either command line argument is
        provided
